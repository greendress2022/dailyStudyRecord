# Preface

I want to keep a record of what I learn every day and the time I devote to learning code in order to keep track of my progress and review. This starts from March 12, the 60th day after starting to learn C and Java.



- Rate is what I feel about this day from score 0-10.
- Exercise is recorded to remind me to take a walk and recharge myself.

## Thoughts:

3/16

When I started to run three days ago, it was tiring and tough. It's been just three days and I am feeling better. I believe the power of efforts and perseverance. Perhaps 30 days later, coding is better for me as well. Bless.
