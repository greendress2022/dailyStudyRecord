# Preface

I want to keep a record of what I learn every day and the time I devote to learning code in order to keep track of my progress and review. This starts from March 12, the 60th day after starting to learn C and Java.



- Rate is from score 0-10, low to high.
- Exercise is recorded to remind me to take a walk and recharge myself.

## Thoughts:

3/16

When I started to run three days ago, it was tiring and tough. It's been just three days and I am feeling better. I believe the power of efforts and perseverance. Perhaps 30 days later, coding is better for me as well. Bless.

This channel is really amazing to clearly explain heap and memory. really appreciate tutors' efforts.

3/20

During this break, I devoted 67.5 hours to review and learn new concepts. I made it to code every day. I set mini missions for every hour. Most of the time, I sticked to my plan and so proud of myself. See, small efforts lead to a giant leap. I am taking baby steps. Keep it up.
